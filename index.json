Square brackets indicate abbreviated references. Because MWG is very terse, I urge you to have at least one additional graduate level microeconomic text at your disposal.\nAdditional graduate-level texts Some other graduate-level texts with which I am familiar and that I believe may be useful are:\n Jehle and Reny (2011), \u0026ldquo;Advanced Microeconomic Theory,'' Prentice Hall, Third Edition [J\u0026amp;R]. Kreps (1990), \u0026ldquo;A Course in Microeconomic Theory,'' Princeton University Press [Kreps]. Varian (1992), \u0026ldquo;Microeconomic Analysis,'' Norton [Big Varian].  Kreps has a newer text that can also be useful and is very inexpensive, especially the electronic versions. I will reference it from time to time (along with J\u0026amp;R and Big Varian), although some of the terminology is non-standard and the development is sometimes overly technical for our purposes. Solutions to many of its problems are available in the free Student\u0026rsquo;s Guide and the math appendices are great; these features alone may make it worth the purchase price.\n Kreps (2013), \u0026ldquo;Microeconomic Foundations I,'' Princeton University Press [KrepsNew].*  MWG, J\u0026amp;R, and KrepsNew are in the bookstore because they are easy for the bookstore to obtain.\nRelevant chapters This table is a rough guide to the places in each book that refer to the broad topics we will cover in ECN 606:\n   Topic MWG Big Varian Kreps J\u0026amp;R Kreps New     Preferences \u0026amp; Utility Functions Ch. 1, 2.A-C, 3.A-C 7.1 2.1 1.1-1.2 Chs. 1-2   Utility Maximization \u0026amp; Demand 2.D, 3.D 7.2-7.5 Ch. 2 1.3 Ch. 3   Comparative Statics of Demand 2.E-F, 3.E-F Chs. 8,9 \u0026mdash; 1.4-1.5 Ch. 4   Production and Cost Ch. 5 Chs. 1,4,5,6 7.1 3.1-3.4 Ch. 9   Profit Maximization and Supply Ch. 5 Chs. 2,3 Ch. 7 3.5 Ch. 9   Uncertainty Ch. 6 Ch. 11 Ch. 3 2.4 Ch. 5   Intertemporal Choice 20.A-D Ch. 19 \u0026mdash; \u0026mdash; Ch. 7    Undergraduate texts I recommend you have a good undergraduate intermediate microeconomics text for developing intuition. I use the 4th edition of Varian\u0026rsquo;s undergraduate text (\u0026ldquo;Baby Varian\u0026rdquo;), but the 7th edition is what has been on reserve.\n Varian (2006), \u0026ldquo;Intermediate Microeconomics : A Modern Approach,\u0026rdquo; Norton, 7th Edition [Baby Varian].  Math references For math references, I find the appendices of MWG often inaccessible and am not aware of others that are comprehensive. I do, however, like KrepsNew\u0026rsquo;s appendices on Real Analysis and Convexity. I am a huge fan of the book listed below on optimization by Dixit as well as Simon and Blume\u0026rsquo;s math for economists book. I will integrate parts of Binmore\u0026rsquo;s and Velleman\u0026rsquo;s books in class and suggest them as background preparation for anyone without a background in Real Analysis. I have made available a list of Real Analysis topics from Corbae et al. with which you should endeavor to be familiar. Corbae et al. presents the material in a more complex way than what is needed for our purposes, so the list is useful as a reference but I don\u0026rsquo;t suggest using this as a text to learn the concepts.\n Dixit (1990), \u0026ldquo;Optimization in Economic Theory,\u0026rdquo; Oxford University Press, Second Edition.

The library will have all of these on reserve when they resume physical reserves in the fall. Two of the books are available in electronic form in the library catalog; they are marked with asterisks.

This is to allow time for everyone to register and be added to Blackboard.\nWhat follows is an overview of what you should prepare for the first portion of producer theory, which I anticipate we will cover in our first 2-3 lectures (August 30, September 1 and perhaps September 6).\nTopic list You will find the Production Topic List in the Production folder once you access Blackboard. It has notations for the primary text source for each topic. These topic lists are the key to guiding your preparation and studying in each section of the course.\nEconomic concepts We begin with production sets, production functions, and properties of technologies (MWG 5.B). You should have a basic understanding of the difference between production sets and production functions as well as familiarity with the properties of technologies listed on the topic list before our first class on Monday, August 30.\nWe will quickly check in to answer any questions about these commonly-assumed properties of production sets from the reading; then we\u0026rsquo;ll see which of these properties we can identify/falsify in the isoquant representation of technologies. You should be familiar with isoquants from math camp. When this is done, we‚Äôll move on to important properties associated with isoquants such as the marginal rate of technical substitution and related concepts such as marginal product, marginal rate of transformation and elasticity of substitution in the production context.\nMath concepts You should prepare/review the following math concepts:\n Level curves: Section C of the Math Handout (Content/Math on Blackboard) Sets: Binmore 1.1 to 1.6 Functions: Binmore 7.1 to 7.8 \u0026ldquo;Cardinal vs. Ordinal\u0026rdquo; handout (Content/Math on Blackboard) Convexity/concavity/quasiconvexity/quasiconcavity  Binmore 12.13 KrepsNew, Appendix sections A3.1, A3.4 and A3.5 contain a useful treatment of the whole suite of ideas around convexity In Content/Math on Blackboard, I\u0026rsquo;ve posted a document that compiles several definitions of quasiconvexity / quasiconcavity as well as scans of the pages from several of the books from which definitions were taken   Elasticity: Section B of the Math Handout  If you have not taken a proof-based math course such as Real Analysis, you should work through the Binmore sections\u0026ndash;especially the examples\u0026ndash;even if the concepts are familiar.\n By \u0026ldquo;work through,\u0026rdquo; I do not mean to just read the section. I mean that you should also try to solve the examples before looking at the answers that are given in the text and then complete the related exercises in the last section of the chapter  The solutions to the Binmore exercises begin on page 251   You do not learn to structure your arguments clearly and precisely (as in proofs, and in general in the way that economists are expected to argue) by looking at proofs.  That\u0026rsquo;s just not the way the human brain works. You learn to structure your arguments clearly and precisely by actually trying to structure your arguments clearly and precisely.  If you start with simple enough arguments, you will eventually succeed and then build on that success by gradually attempting to make increasingly complex arguments clear and precise.      Questions?

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-814526937', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.

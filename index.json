We apply this method to value multifamily apartments in Los Angeles, California over the 2001 - 2019 time period and compare it to a standard hedonic model. Our model performs better both in- and out-of-sample, maintaining robustness despite changing market conditions. We also illustrate how to use our approach to value a European call option to purchase a CRE.

This logical fallacy is causing frequent confusion in current biology, especially in neuroscience. In order to clarify this problem, we first dissect the structure of this incorrect logic (which we refer to as ‘misapplied-N\u0026S’) to show how necessity and sufficiency in misapplied-N\u0026S are not matching each other. Potential pitfalls of utilizing misapplied-N\u0026S are exemplified by cases such as the discrediting of command neurons and other potentially key neurons, the distorting of truth in optogenetic studies, and the wrongful justification of studies with little meaning. In particular, the use of the word ‘sufficient’ in optogenetics tends to generate misunderstandings by opening up multiple interpretations. To avoid the confusion caused by the misleading logic, we now recommend using ‘indispensable and inducing’ instead of using ‘necessary and sufficient.’ However, we ultimately recommend fully articulating the limits of what our experiments suggest, not relying on such simple phrases. Only after this problem is fully understood and more rigorous language is demanded, can we finally interpret experimental results in an accurate way.

Using comprehensive data on commercial leasing and occupancy, this paper shows evidence of filtering in commercial real estate. Each year, the typical office property early in its life cycle depreciates by about 0.9 percent. Since leased space per user declines by about 2 percent per year while employment declines by 1.5 percent per year, buildings become more intensively used as they age. These changes are due entirely to shifts in the mix of tenants as buildings age. Tenants in older buildings are less productive and have higher labor shares with only about one-fifth of these shifts accounted for by changes in building industrial composition with age.
